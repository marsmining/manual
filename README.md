## Manual

### Summary

Just a place to stash my answers, in Clojure, while going through problems in [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). To make it more fun, gonna try out [Processing](http://processing.org) for the first time via the Clojure lib, [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil), to visualize some problems and solutions.
